# To redesign the lang
Evaluate everything in its most basic terms.

### For example:
```py
for x in list:
  //do something with x
```
### Becomes:
  How can we do an action with each item in a list?  
  What would be easiest for people to understand?
  Forget that any other programming language exists.
  
  We want to make something new, I don't care if its hard for people to transition to it from pyton or javascript, it needs to be something good, something easy, and something extensible.
  Like, maybe something like this:
  ```
  with every item in list {
    //do something
  }
  ``` 
  or 
  ```
  doSomething() with every item in list
  ```
  Evaluate everything in its most basic form. `output()` becomes move this value to this register, How can we move that value to that register to make a terminal output?

Yea, it was just an example, to think diferently and to not be afraid to inovate for fear of no backwards compatibility or a hard transition from other languages.


Ok, I will continue typing in 1 min. Any ideas or questions?
Ready? ok

# When you have a new idea:
  (later on, in the begining there will be way too many new ideas to do all this)
  
  Everytime a member of the team has a new idea, discus it with the group and in the server. If the plan is green-lighted by the rest of the team, then finalize the idea's design and immediately add it to docs.md and make a example file where you show off your ideas, reference the example file in your docs section. Then post the finalized idea in the server for everyone to view.



## And thats it for the ideas section of the new Aardvark plan
